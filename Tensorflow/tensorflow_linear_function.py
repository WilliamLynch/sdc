# ## Tensorflow Linear Function

# * Letâ€™s derive the function y = Wx + b. 
# * We want to translate our input, x, to labels, y.
# * For example, imagine we want to classify images as digits.
#     * x would be our list of pixel values
#     y would be the logits, one for each digit. 
# * If we look at y = Wx, where the weights, W, determine the influence of x at predicting each y
#     * y = Wx allows us to segment the data into their respective labels using a line.
#     * This line has to pass through the origin, because whenever x equals 0, then y is also going to equal 0
#     * We want the ability to shift the line away from the origin to fit more complex data. 
#         * That's why we have the bias term.
# * But with this bias term, our equation is now y = Wx + b
#     * This bias term allows us to create predictions on linearly separable data.
